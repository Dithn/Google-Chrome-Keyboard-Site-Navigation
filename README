SUPPORT
===============================================================================

See the files "supported_webcomics.txt" and "supported_websites.txt" for a list of sites that allow this extension to work by using the HTML5 "link relations" attributes.


RELATED WORK
==============================================================================
Opera
-----------------------
The Opera browser sometimes works with inbuilt navigation, though unpredictably.
It offeres a "navigation" toolbar, with the standard "rel" featureset. However,
it doesn't work on qwantz.com.  It also advertises a "Fast Forward" feature, which
is supposed to pre-load the "next" page in a series.

It may be that Opera only supports the "rel" attribute on a <link> tag, whereas the
HTML5 spec says it can appear in all of <link>, <a>, and <area>.  However, Opera does
support moving to the "next" page on Reddit, although its Navigation toolbar remains disabled.

Firefox
-----------------------

TODO
==============================================================================

* Use single-arrow indicators, only use the left half of the icon for directions.
Use right half for the "manual rule" indicator.

* Test "shout-out" comics on http://www.qwantz.com/

ISSUES
===============================================================================

Potentially a website might list multiple "next" or "prev" relations on a page. This may call for a special indicator in the icon.

As one example, check out this page:
http://www.nuklearpower.com/2010/06/01/the-epilogue/

If you navigate forward, you will reach the next blog entry. If you then navigate backward, you will not return to the last panel of the webcomic, but will instead reach the previous blog entry by date.
